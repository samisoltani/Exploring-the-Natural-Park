# Exploring-the-Natural-Park
This project includes five main teleport stations in which there are different interactions for players to do. This VR experience designed for Desktop VR (without headset) and works with Arrow Keys and Gaze-Mouse, giving people an opportunity to explore a natural fantasy environment.

This prototype can be developed for an IVR experiment to examine how it will improve children’s soft skills, designed various activities regarding these skills. A player as a child can learn, practice, and get instant feedback about their performance. 
This experience can be integrated with an AI assistant who mentors children during the process, giving a piece of advice on how to interact with people and how to be a better team player. 

## Features
As a prototype, it is designed for one level and 5 stations: Entry Station, River Station, Game Station, Cloud Station, Jungle Station. 

Every teleport station shows a menu to choose, which works with Gaze -Mouse and a tour guide will appear to give you some information about each station.

The environment is a safe place and although there are some animals to see, none are wild.
